Dummy content, to prevent the NuGet error message
"External packages cannot depend on packages that target projects"
when someone installs this package. That error message occurs when intalling
a package that has no content and the depends on some other package.

This file will be deleted by the 
install.ps1
file in the 
tools
directory of the package.
