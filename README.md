# JSNLog

JSNLog lets you insert loggers in your client side JavaScript, configure them in your web.config, and store their messages in your server side logs - without any server side coding.

Installation is quick, and the default configuration gets you started right away. You could be logging from your JavaScript 10 minutes from now.
